 # Welcome to Swift Street

 ## The Struggle of Self Awareness
 
 ### Crawling through Life
 Woah. Did I really just write "The Struggle of Self Awareness"? Thats pretty heavy for a "welcome" blog post. But in reality, it really sums up what I hope to be a pillar of this blog. To me, self awareness is one of the most important qualities a person can possess, and one which can always be honed further. Just as a developer needs to keep up with the latest technologies and trends, so too does an indivdual need to keep up with her/himself. From the moment I was born, I have been on a journey of self awareness. Its easy to forgot just how unaware I once was. My beautiful baby daughter reminds me of this daily. She has just mastered the art of crawling. The moment she is set free, she finds her knees and sets out on grand adventures across the hardwood floors, never knowing what she might find next. On her journey, she might encounter a full lenth mirror. She might pause, smile, and reach out to the mirror. But she has know idea that the baby looking back at her is herself. In fact, she likely doesn't realize or comprehend that she is a *self*. Instead, she will quickly get bored, and once again set out on her expidition. She scoots across the floors without ever stopping to ask herself any questions. Why am I crawling? Where am I crawling to? Are there better ways to get around besides crawling? Does my crawling affect others? Is my shockingly fast pace and knack for finding the most dangerous objects and situations in the house making my parents into giant knots of anxiousness? No, none of these practical questions are ever asked, instead she simply continues her journey, crawling through her early stages of life.
 
 ### Asking some questions
 Ok, lets focus this back towards Swift otherwise I might have some very confused readers. Ok, what does my crawling baby have to do with programming and this blog? Well at different times and in different parts of our lives we are all like my daughter. Sometimes we crawl through life or our professional careers, on autopilot. We forget to stop, look in the mirror, and ask the important questions. 1. Who am I? 2. Where am I and why am I there? 3. What am I working on and why I am working on it? 4. Why am I working in the way in which I am working? 5. Why do I use *this* technique? 6. Why haven't I explored *that* techinque? 7. Who am I becoming as a developer or who have I been as a developer? (8. Am I *that* developer? üò≥) 9. Is the code I am writing helping or hurting people? 10. Is there anything I am blind to right now? 11. Am I over correcting for anything? 12. Is focusing on being self aware actually paralyzing me instead of enabling me? 13. Am I relying on lists of questions to heavily in my writing?
 
 ### Answering some questions
 Alright, if I am going to ask all those questions, I might as well answer some of them for you. Especially since I went through the trouble of numbering them... 1. My name is Luke Street, I am a developer who loves working with Swift, be it in iOS, scripting, serverside, or anywhere else I can write it. I am also a husband, father, Austinite, proud Hoosier native, and person that thinks he can answer "Who am I?" in two sentences. 2. I currently work for athenahealth as an iOS developer on [Epocrates](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/epocrates/id281935788) and 3. I am here because I feel like I am making a difference in the lives of patients. (Disclaimer: this blog has no affiliation with athenahealth or Epocrates. I don't know if I need to say that but I've seen it in other blogs, so...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) 2. I also am taking a shot at blogging and 3. I am here because I grew up loving to write and now this feels like a chance to resurrect an old passion and marry it to a new one. Also, in the interest of self-awareness, I think there is probably "rockstar" dev envy happening in some deep, bizarre place in my mind where nerdyness and vanity intersect. Huge Twitter following, here I come! And maybe one day, the ultimate developer dream...**PODCASTER** üéô 4. I try to work with compassion, empathy, and you guessed it - self awareness. I do this because, as much as possible, I want to avoid crawling on autopilot. I want to live my life with my head up and my eyes wide open. 5. I use *this* technique because it makes sense to me and I haven't yet found a reason that has convince me not to. 6. I haven't looked into *that* techique because its foreign and scares me and sometimes I'm just not in the mood to be scared. 7. I am hopefully becoming a better paid developer üòÇ. But in all seriousness I would like to think I am becoming a well rounded developer that earns respect through solid contributions and service to my collegues and not through big words and a cocky attitude. 8. I hope that I am not *that* developer, though I know that if unchecked, my personality could lead me to be a variation of *that* developer. 9. I sure hope my code is helping people and I feel confident that it is. 10. Talk about questions that really can only have answer...not that I can see! But I do believe this is an important question to refelct on and always have in the back of your mind. 11. When you are as good at me at self-awareness there is no such thing as over correcting. I would *never* realize its important to be self aware and then correct by think *way to long* about being self aware...and I also would *never* realize I am very self-conscious with a healthy dose of imposter syndrome and over correct with a sacarstic and overconfident writing voice! 12. Hopefully not, but after all the time I have spent on this expos√© on self-awareness, I probably could have written a couple of practical posts...so... 13. Oh yes. Definitely. There is no better way to drive home a point then with a ridiculously long list of questions. I also have been switching between 1st, 2nd, and I think even 3rd tense and I have no plans on fixing it.
 
 ### The Point
 Often when I read blog posts or consume other content in the community, I see polished, well-researched, final forms of an idea or technique. And most of the time, that is exactly what I want! It makes for really great and useful content. But in this blog, I want to pull back the curtain a little bit and try to expose the process that my mind undergoes as I am learning and growing. My work and opinions will not be perfect, they will not be fully formed, and they will evolve. I think one surefire metric for success will be if a year from now, after I have hopefully achieved my now public goal of writing 52 posts in 2019, I read back to the first few articles and think, "Wow...I was such an idiot!" If that happens, then I will consider this whole experiment a great success. And if I am really lucky, maybe I'll help some of you call your old self an idiot as well.
 
 ### TLDR
 
 I am going to be writing about Swift stuff. Sometimes I'll get deep and philosophical. Come learn and grow with me. Good discussion is always encouraged. Don't crawl like a baby.
